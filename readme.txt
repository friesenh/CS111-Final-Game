Our program allows the user to play a "Frogger," cross-the-road style game. 
With each new level, one more car is added, making each level increasingly more difficult. 
There are 5 total levels in the game. The user has the ability to pick between red, 
blue, green, and random for the color of the player.

The game is organized into four classes. The Car, Road, and Player classes are 
subclasses of the GraphicsObject class in graphics.py. The FroggerGame class
deals with game play and game status updates.

Instructions will be printed when the user clicks "run". Once the user
clicks "run," the user will also be prompted to input a color for their
character. Any input other than 'red,' 'blue,' or 'green,'
(regardless of capitilization), will choose a random color. Once the user
types a color and hits <enter> on their keyboard, the user must click
their mouse within the graphics window before their key presses will
register. If the player loses or wins the game, the program can be re-run.
